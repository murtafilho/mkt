## ⚙️ PHPStan Level 5 - Static Analysis

### **Resultado:**
```
✅ No errors
📁 104 arquivos analisados
⏱️ Tempo de execução: < 5s
```

## 🔧 Fix Aplicado

### **EmailVerificationTest - Redirect assertion**

**Problema:**
```php
// ❌ Esperava redirect com ?verified=1
$response->assertRedirect(route('dashboard', absolute: false).'?verified=1');
```

**Solução:**
```php
// ✅ Laravel 12 não adiciona ?verified=1 automaticamente
$response->assertRedirect(route('dashboard', absolute: false));
```

**Motivo:** Laravel 12 simplificou o comportamento de email verification, removendo o query parameter `?verified=1` do redirect.

## 📈 Performance dos Testes

### **Testes Mais Lentos:**
```
1. can upload both logo and banner during registration  → 5.06s
2. can upload banner during registration                → 3.90s
3. can upload logo during registration                  → 1.54s
4. can publish product                                  → 1.45s
5. admin can access dashboard                           → 0.44s
```

**Nota:** Testes de upload são naturalmente mais lentos devido ao processamento de imagens (validação, resize, conversão).

### **Tempo Médio por Teste:**
- **Total:** 28.89s para 275 testes
- **Média:** ~0.10s por teste
- **Máximo:** 5.06s (upload completo)
- **Mínimo:** 0.02s (testes unitários simples)
